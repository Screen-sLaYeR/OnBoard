# Queue Management

This is an ESP-12F Controlled board with CD4511 IC used to display 3-digit numbers using 7-segment displays. I am making a wireless 3-digit 7-segment display driver used to display the current token number from a queue. 
This project is similar to many systems present in Banks, Doctor's Clinic and McDonald's, where if you have  an appointment or have ordered something, you will be provided with a token number and the number then will be displayed on this board using 7 segment displays
This project is helpful for queue management
