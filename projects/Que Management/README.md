# Queue Management

This is an ESP-12F Controlled board with CD4511 IC used to display 3-digit numbers using 7-segment displays. I am making a wireless 3-digit 7-segment display driver used to display the current token number from a queue. 
This project is similar to many systems present in Banks, Doctor's Clinic and McDonald's, where if you have  an appointment or have ordered something, you will be provided with a token number and the number then will be displayed on this board using 7 segment displays
This project is helpful for queue management

# BOM

| Service / Product  | Cost   |
| ------------- | ------ |
| PCB           | $2.00  |
| Shipping      | $17.01 |
| ESP12F x 5        | $13.62 |
| CD4511 x 5       | $10.30 |
| 7 Segment Display x 15        | $18.04 |
| NodeMCU 8266 x 3        | $16.57 |
| 0.96 inch Oled display  x 3        | $17.97 |
| Total         | $95.51 |

Rest the Solder and the assembly can be done my self.

Earlier I tested it on my Prototyping Breadboard. The programming of ESP-12F was only, the hard part because it is not breadboard-friendly we had to hold the wire until the programming was done.
